) AS row_num

-- 2. Standardising data

-- 3. Nulls & Blanks

UPDATE layoffs_staging2 -- First update any blank spaces to NULL so that we can manipulate data properly later on, if left blank it messes with the UPDATE/SET further down
SET industry = NULL

-- 4. Remove Columns & Rows

SELECT *
FROM layoffs_staging2
WHERE total_laid_off IS NULL
AND percentage_laid_off IS NULL;

DELETE
