  PROJECT: Global Tech Layoffs â€“ Exploratory Data Analysis
  DESCRIPTION:
    This script analyzes layoff trends using cleaned data from the `layoffs_staging2` table.
    Key insights include:
    - Layoffs by company, country, and year
    - Funding stage and industry impact
    - Rolling monthly and annual layoffs using window functions
    - Top locations and companies per year using DENSE_RANK()

    Output from this file would support dashboard visuals and reporting.
